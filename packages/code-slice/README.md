# Agent Code Slice

Precise, language-aware code context for AI coding agents.

> Status: **V0.1 core Verified**. Published package: `agent-code-slice@0.4.0` (npm `latest`). The cross-agent Code Slice Skill is implemented for Codex and Claude Code project workflows; vendor-version live E2E remains unverified.
> npm publishing is guarded by `release:version-check`, `release:check`, and `prepack`: an already-published version fails before release, verification runs before publish, and `dist/` is rebuilt automatically before the tarball is created. No MCP server is planned; the CLI, JS API, and project-scoped Skills remain the supported integration surfaces.

Agent Code Slice is a local-first, read-only developer tool that extracts the exact syntactic code unit an AI coding agent needs instead of forcing the agent to read an entire source file.

The current product is designed to work with any AI coding agent that can use one or more of:

- shell / terminal commands;
- a JavaScript / Node.js API.

Target integrations include Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, AGRUN, VM-MCP, and other coding agents. A future serverless adapter is a separate planned integration; support must be verified by real end-to-end tests before being marked as supported.

## Install globally for Codex CLI

Install the published CLI from any directory; no repository checkout or `cd` is required:

```bash
npm install --global agent-code-slice@latest
code-slice capabilities --json
```


Codex can use the checked-in project skill from `.agents/skills/agent-code-slice/SKILL.md`. The global install provides the terminal CLI; it does not automatically register a host-specific skill.

## Why

AI coding agents frequently read large source files when they only need one function, method, class, query, or logical block. This increases context usage and makes navigation less precise.

Agent Code Slice targets this flow:

```text
Large source file
      |
      v
Language detection
      |
      v
Tree-sitter WASM parser
      |
      v
Language adapter
      |
      v
Normalized symbol IR
      |
      v
Exact code slice
      |
      v
AI coding agent
```

The project is intentionally not a code search engine, repository indexer, RAG system, formatter, linter, or autonomous coding agent.

## For AI coding agents

If you are an AI coding agent and `code-slice` is installed (`npm install -D agent-code-slice`, or already a dependency of the project you're working in), prefer it over reading a whole file when you only need one symbol, one line's container, or one range.

**Decision rule:** know the file and a symbol name → use `symbol`. Know the file and a line number (e.g. from a stack trace or lint error) → use `line`. Don't know what's in the file yet → start with `outline --compact`, follow `result.page.nextOffset` only when needed, then use `symbol` on what you find. Use full `outline` only when you actually need native kinds, byte/column coordinates, signatures, or the complete structural record. Don't know if this file's language is supported → check `capabilities` or just try; it fails closed with a machine-readable error rather than guessing.

```bash
# What can this tool do, and what languages does it support?
code-slice capabilities --json

# What's in this file? Compact discovery defaults to a 200-symbol page.
code-slice outline src/app.ts --compact --json

# Continue only when result.page.hasMore is true.
code-slice outline src/app.ts --compact --offset 200 --json

# For a high-level map only.
code-slice outline src/app.ts --compact --top-level --json

# Give me exactly this function/method/class/query — nothing else.
code-slice symbol src/app.ts calculateTotal --json

# Disambiguate a large class directly by owner + member.
code-slice symbol src/oauth.ts OwnerOAuthProvider.commit --max-lines 120 --json

# A stack trace or lint error points at a line — what's the enclosing unit?
code-slice line src/app.ts 382 --json

# I know roughly where, but not the exact boundaries — expand to a normalized symbol.
code-slice range src/app.ts 380:390 --expand --json

# Stay local inside a large method/class using the smallest named syntax node.
code-slice range src/oauth.ts 920:940 --smallest --max-lines 120 --json
```

Every command above prints **exactly one JSON document to stdout** when `--json` is passed (Core results use `schemas/code-slice-result-v1.schema.json`; CLI usage errors use the additive `schemas/code-slice-result-v1.1.schema.json`, both described in `docs/JSON_SCHEMA.md`) — safe to pipe and parse directly, e.g. `code-slice symbol src/app.ts calculateTotal --json | jq -r .result.code`. Diagnostics go to stderr, never stdout.

Compact outline is intentionally discovery-only: each entry keeps `kind`, `name`, a line-only range, parent identity when present, embedded-language identity, dynamic-name state, and warning codes. It omits signatures, native parser kinds, columns, and byte offsets; fetch the chosen symbol for those details. Full outline remains available and backward compatible. Every outline result includes `result.page` with `total`, `returned`, `offset`, `limit`, `truncated`, `hasMore`, and `nextOffset` when another page exists.

Read `result.code` for the exact text; do not re-derive it from `result.range` yourself. On failure, check `error.code` (stable values like `SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND`, `SYMBOL_AMBIGUOUS`, `LANGUAGE_UNSUPPORTED` — full list in `docs/JSON_SCHEMA.md`) rather than parsing `error.message`, and fall back to reading the file normally — this tool never guesses a symbol, language, or boundary, so an error here is real signal, not a bug to route around. `SYMBOL_AMBIGUOUS` includes bounded `candidates`; either narrow with `--kind`, use a qualified `Owner.member` name when the parent is known, or pick a candidate and say which. `RANGE_INVALID` may include structured `error.details.suggestion`; `--clamp` only applies a safe overlapping end-of-file suggestion.

`code-slice` is navigation, not correctness proof. A good coding-agent loop is: **code-slice → understand the target code → run the focused typecheck/test/runtime check → run the broader regression suite**. It does not validate filesystem semantics, network results, permissions, database transactions, or business correctness by itself.

From Node.js/TypeScript, the same three operations are a JS API (`import { capabilities, outline, slice } from "agent-code-slice"` — see below) if shelling out isn't convenient.

**Current honest limits, so you don't assume more than what's real:** No MCP server or MCP/stdio adapter is planned. The canonical project Skill and Codex/Claude Code entrypoints are provided under `integrations/agent-code-slice/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `.claude/skills/`; vendor-version-specific live E2E remains unverified. The future serverless adapter is still planned (see `ROADMAP.md`). Only JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Python, and CFML/CFScript/CFQuery are supported (`docs/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`); TypeScript discovery includes enums, namespace/module declarations, callable class fields, and function-valued object properties; CFML `<script>`/`<style>` regions are re-parsed as JavaScript/CSS, while standalone CSS is not a registered host adapter. Anything else returns `LANGUAGE_UNSUPPORTED`. Core applies bounded file, symbol, serialized-output, and optional slice-line budgets; `maxOutputBytes` accepts 256 bytes through 8 MiB, `maxLines` can bound a resolved slice without truncating it, malformed limits fail closed with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and oversized valid results or error envelopes return `OUTPUT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` rather than being silently truncated. Release CI covers the new CFML embedded paths, the declared Node floor, and `0.2.0` registry installation on Windows/macOS/Ubuntu; standalone CSS, serverless, vendor-specific agent certification, and broader performance guarantees remain outside the current evidence.

## Product principles

1. **Local-first** — source code is parsed on the user's machine.
2. **No hosted backend required** — no cloud service, database, account, or API key is required for the core product.
3. **Read-only** — V0.1 reads and parses files; it does not edit them.
4. **Deterministic** — no LLM is required to decide code boundaries.
5. **Fail closed** — ambiguous symbols produce explicit candidates instead of guessed results.
6. **Multi-language** — one stable contract across languages.
7. **On-demand integration** — CLI is the lowest common compatibility layer; JS API and any future serverless wrapper are thin adapters over Core, with no resident MCP server.
8. **Small public contract** — stable CLI, JSON schema, and JS API; implementation details remain replaceable.

See [docs/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md](docs/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).

## CLI

```bash
code-slice capabilities --json
code-slice outline src/app.ts --compact --top-level --json
code-slice symbol src/app.ts OwnerOAuthProvider.commit --max-lines 120 --json
code-slice line src/app.ts 382 --max-lines 80 --json
code-slice range src/app.ts 380:390 --smallest --max-lines 120 --json
```

For machine consumers:

```text
stdout = result data
stderr = diagnostics
exit code = execution status
```

No banners, progress prose, or logging may be mixed into `stdout` when `--json` is active.

## JavaScript API

```js
import { capabilities, outline, slice } from "agent-code-slice";

const result = await slice({
  file: "src/app.ts",
  selector: {
    type: "symbol",
    name: "calculateTotal"
  }
});
```

## Planned serverless adapter

The future serverless adapter is intentionally stateless and read-only:

- one request invokes `capabilities`, `outline`, or `slice`;
- the response uses the same versioned JSON envelope and stable error codes;
- the wrapper delegates to Core and does not duplicate parsing logic.

It will not expose MCP/stdio or require a long-running process. A cloud
function cannot access a caller's local path by default, so the source-input,
authentication, privacy, size, timeout, and logging contract must be selected
before implementation. See [Serverless integration](docs/SERVERLESS_INTEGRATION.md).

## Agent compatibility model

| Agent | Current integration | Future optional integration |
|---|---|---|
| Codex CLI | CLI + project Skill | Serverless wrapper |
| Claude Code | CLI + project Skill | Serverless wrapper |
| Gemini CLI | CLI | Serverless wrapper or Extension |
| OpenCode | CLI | Serverless wrapper or Custom Tool |
| AGRUN | JS API | Serverless wrapper |
| VM-MCP | CLI | None provided by Code Slice |
| Other agents | CLI if shell exists | JS API or serverless wrapper if supported |

The public compatibility statement should be:

> Works with AI coding agents that can use shell commands or JavaScript. Project
> Skills are provided for Codex CLI and Claude Code; vendor-version live
> compatibility remains unverified. A future serverless adapter is a separate
> planned integration.

Do not claim "supports all AI agents."

## Parser foundation

The default V0.1 design uses:

```text
web-tree-sitter
+
pinned Tree-sitter WASM grammars
+
per-language adapters
```

Why:

- portable across Windows, macOS, and Linux;
- avoids making native compilation a base install requirement;
- suitable for Node.js now and possible browser use later;
- preserves direct control over AST and mixed-language slicing.

Native Tree-sitter may be evaluated later as an optional performance backend. `ast-grep` is treated as a complementary tool and benchmark competitor, not the core dependency.

## V0.1 Definition of Done

V0.1 is not complete until:

- the Core API, CLI, and JSON schema are stable and versioned;
- JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Python, and CFML fixtures pass language-specific golden tests;
- ambiguous symbols fail closed;
- line and range expansion return deterministic syntactic containers;
- malformed input returns warnings/errors without invented symbols;
- CLI JSON mode keeps stdout machine-clean;
- no core path requires network access, a hosted service, an account, or an API key;
- packaged WASM grammars pass load tests and integrity checks;
- Windows, macOS, and Linux install/run smoke tests pass;
- documented benchmark results are generated from frozen fixtures rather than marketing claims.
