# Testing and Golden Eval

## Principle

The project must prove:

> Less context, same required code evidence.

Do not evaluate only whether output "looks useful."

## Test layers

### Unit

- path/range validation;
- selector validation;
- normalized kind mapping;
- error mapping;
- JSON serialization;
- output limits.

### Grammar load

Every packaged WASM grammar:

- loads;
- reports expected language identity;
- matches recorded hash;
- parses a minimal fixture.

### Language certification

Per language:

- outline;
- symbol;
- line;
- range;
- nested container;
- overloaded/ambiguous symbol;
- malformed source;
- comments/strings containing fake syntax;
- Unicode.

### Mixed-language

CFML first:

- CFML host;
- CFScript;
- CFQuery;
- JavaScript `<script>` region;
- CSS `<style>` region;
- SQL-level CFQuery clauses/functions;
- malformed injection;
- dynamic query name.

## Frozen Golden Eval

Each case stores:

```json
{
  "id": "ts-symbol-001",
  "file": "fixtures/typescript/basic.ts",
  "operation": "symbol",
  "selector": {
    "name": "calculateTotal"
  },
  "expected": {
    "kind": "function",
    "startLine": 10,
    "endLine": 14
  }
}
```

The candidate implementation must not redefine expected results after seeing failures without versioning/reviewing the evaluator.

## Current declarative runner

The repository now runs frozen case files from `test/golden/cases/*.json` through
the public Core API. Run the evaluator directly with:

```bash
npm run test:golden
```

The same cases are also exercised by `npm test` through
`test/unit/golden-eval.test.ts`. Case files are loaded in deterministic filename
order and then evaluated in `id` order. A case failure reports its case ID and
does not rewrite or regenerate the expected result. Every actual Core envelope
is validated against `schemas/code-slice-result-v1.schema.json` before its case
assertions run. CLI argument-shape failures are covered separately by the
agent-facing E2E suite and validate against the additive v1.1 CLI envelope.

The runner accepts the four delivery-level operations below. `symbol`, `line`,
and `range` are mapped to the corresponding Core `slice()` selector; `outline`
calls Core `outline()`.

```json
{
  "id": "ts-symbol-001",
  "file": "test/fixtures/typescript/basic.ts",
  "operation": "symbol",
  "selector": {
    "name": "calculateTotal"
  },
  "expected": {
    "kind": "function",
    "name": "calculateTotal",
    "startLine": 10,
    "endLine": 12,
    "codeIncludes": ["export function calculateTotal"]
  }
}
```

Success cases may assert `kind`, `name`, `embeddedLanguage`, `signature`, any
range fields, exact `code`, `codeIncludes`, envelope `warningCodes`, or an
outline's exact `symbols`/`symbolCount`. Failure cases set `"ok": false` and
assert `errorCode`, with optional `recoverable`, `candidateCount`, and
`warningCodes`. Files must be repository-relative and stay inside the
repository; malformed case definitions fail closed before execution.

The checked-in cases cover all current adapters, all four selector operations,
exact range text, BOM byte coordinates, whitespace-aware line/range container
selection, TypeScript enum/namespace/class-field/object-callable symbols, CFML
JavaScript/CSS embedding, SQL-level CFQuery symbols, ambiguity, not-found
behavior, and malformed-source warnings. Explicitly
unsupported/dynamic HTML region types are covered by the CFML unit fixture and
are skipped rather than guessed.

### Cross-platform evidence

CI run
[33888822744](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33888822744)
passed the then-current 12 cases on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu with Node 20 and
Node 22. The run also passed the then-current 39-test unit suite, grammar
integrity check, CLI smoke test, and `npm pack --dry-run` step. The checked-in set now has **23 cases**. The 0.4.0 release path has three
separate evidence layers: PR-head CI run
[34096967717](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/34096967717)
passed 80 unit tests, 23 Golden cases, 6 agent-facing E2E cases, all nine
Windows/macOS/Ubuntu × Node 18.18.0/20/22 test jobs, and all three Node 20
benchmark jobs; exact merge-commit CI run
[34099721362](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/34099721362)
passed the same matrix at the published npm gitHead
`512479fa702f6bb694c44815534302459f449745`; and post-publication workflow
run 34109729432, dispatched on the automation fork but pinned to that exact
release commit and using the same checked-in CI workflow, installed
`agent-code-slice@0.4.0` from npm on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu with Node 20
and passed the public API/CLI plus CFML embedding smoke on all three platforms.

The V0.2 release CI run
[33936169516](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33936169516)
passed the previous 16 cases, 47-test suite, grammar integrity check, CLI smoke
test, and `npm pack --dry-run` on all nine Windows/macOS/Ubuntu × Node 18.18.0/20/22
jobs. This covers the new CFML embedded JS/CSS/SQL paths and the declared Node
floor. Hardening CI run
[33972164494](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33972164494)
passed the 55-test suite, 16 Golden cases, 3 agent-facing E2E cases, and the
three Node 20 benchmark jobs. Release CI run
[33937790994](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33937790994)
also passed the core checks and completed registry installation plus CFML
embedding verification on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu with Node 20.

## Metrics

### Exact target accuracy

Correct requested unit selected.

Target before V1.0: define from baseline; do not publish arbitrary percentages as facts before the suite exists.

### Boundary accuracy

Correct start/end line and byte range.

### Ambiguity precision

Ambiguous cases must not become guessed successes.

### Invented-symbol rate

Required: `0`.

### Context reduction

Compare returned code bytes/lines/tokens against full source.

### Parser warning integrity

Malformed fixtures must surface expected warning/error state.

### Schema validity

Every Core operation result and future serverless JSON result validates against
the v1 schema; CLI usage errors validate against the additive v1.1 schema.

## Benchmark cohorts

At minimum:

- 5 KB;
- 50 KB;
- 500 KB;
- 1 MB where realistic.

Measure separately:

- cold grammar startup;
- warm parse;
- outline;
- symbol resolution.

## Cross-platform

Before stable release:

- Windows;
- macOS;
- Linux.

Record Node versions, architecture, and package version.

## Agent-facing contract E2E

The deterministic agent-facing suite runs the built package across its actual
integration boundaries:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

It uses an isolated temporary workspace and verifies this representative agent
journey:

1. call the CLI `outline` on a large fixture;
2. call the CLI `symbol` operation for the discovered symbol;
3. verify the returned code exactly matches its byte range and reduces context;
4. verify an ambiguous symbol returns exit code `7`, candidates, and a safe
   normal-read fallback;
5. call the built public JS API for the same contract;
6. validate every machine envelope against the published schema and verify the
   authorized workspace is unchanged, including file content and metadata.

This is protocol-level agent E2E: it proves the package boundary an agent can
invoke through shell or JavaScript, without making model calls. It must not be
reported as Codex, Claude, Gemini, or OpenCode behavioral certification. Those
vendor-specific live runs remain opt-in and are tracked separately in
`docs/AGENT_INTEGRATIONS.md`.

The CI test matrix is configured to run this suite on Windows, macOS, and
Ubuntu across the declared Node versions. Hardening CI run
[33972164494](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33972164494)
passed the suite on all nine matrix jobs. This is package-level cross-platform
evidence, not Codex, Claude, Gemini, or OpenCode behavioral certification. Do
not combine its result with parser accuracy or latency metrics.

## Runtime hardening coverage

The unit suite also covers runtime request validation, bounded symbol/output
budgets, parser/tree cleanup after successful and throwing visitors, and
coalescing concurrent first grammar loads. These checks protect the local
agent process from malformed requests and native WASM resource retention; they
do not replace cross-platform CI or an OS-level memory profile.

## Regression rule

Every parser defect fixed must preserve the original failing fixture.
