# Performance Benchmark

Status: the reproducible benchmark runner is implemented. The checked-in
report is a local macOS evidence set; the earlier CI run
[33944283579](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33944283579)
passed the same cohort on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS with Node 20 and uploaded
one artifact per job. Hardening CI run
[33972164494](https://github.com/yapweijun1996/AI-Agent-Tools/actions/runs/33972164494)
also passed the benchmark jobs on all three platforms and uploaded one
non-expired artifact per job. The current report's warm API repetitions run in one
isolated worker per target, so its RSS rows are not accumulated across grammar
cohorts. Do not treat the local report or a single CI artifact as a universal
latency/memory promise. Regenerate via:

```bash
npm run benchmark:fixtures && npm run build && npm run --silent benchmark
```

The runner covers every current host adapter (JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX,
Python, and CFML), all four documented sizes, grammar/fixture hashes, cold
CLI and warm API paths, engine phases, output/context reduction, and a
post-operation RSS observation.

## Question

Is `web-tree-sitter` WASM fast enough for interactive single-file AI agent navigation?

## Compare

- Agent Code Slice WASM engine;
- optional native prototype if created;
- raw full-file read as context baseline;
- structural navigation competitor(s) such as ast-grep where comparable.

## Inputs

Per initial language:

- small ~5 KB;
- medium ~50 KB;
- large ~500 KB;
- stress ~1 MB.

Use fixed fixtures and publish fixture hashes.

## Measurements

- process startup;
- Tree-sitter initialization;
- grammar load;
- parse;
- outline extraction;
- exact symbol extraction;
- peak memory where practical;
- full outline output bytes/lines;
- default compact-outline page bytes and compact-vs-full reduction;
- exact symbol output/code bytes and context-reduction ratio.

The benchmark has a correctness gate before it emits a report: every fixture
must parse without a recovery error, `fn0` must be present, CLI JSON and stderr
must be clean, and cold/warm result envelopes must be byte-for-byte equal.

Compact-outline measurements use the public Core API with `compact: true`, so
they include the default 200-symbol page and its complete JSON envelope. This
metric is explicitly about **delivered agent context**. It does not claim that
pagination skips parsing or normalized-symbol extraction for the request.

## Cold vs warm

Report both:

- cold first invocation;
- warm same-process invocation.

Do not mix them into one average.

## Acceptance

Do not invent a latency threshold before baseline measurement.

V0.1 gate should be evidence-driven:

- no pathological hangs on supported fixture sizes;
- interactive latency is documented;
- any unsupported size is bounded by explicit max input policy;
- WASM/native tradeoff is reported honestly.

## Reproducibility

Benchmark output should record:

- OS;
- architecture;
- Node version;
- package commit/version;
- grammar hashes;
- fixture hashes;
- repetitions;
- command.

Cold samples run through `test/benchmark/cold-worker.mjs`. Each worker starts a
fresh CLI process for every repetition, while keeping the long-lived report
process from accumulating WASM child-process teardown state. Warm samples run
through `test/benchmark/warm-worker.mjs`: one worker per target performs the
untimed grammar prime and all same-process API repetitions, then reports its
post-operation RSS after explicit GC passes between operations. The benchmark
launches that worker with `--expose-gc` for a comparable steady-state sample;
this flag is not used by the product runtime. On Node 23 and later the benchmark adds the recorded
`--no-maglev` runtime flag because the current macOS 26 host can otherwise
leave repeated WASM CLI children in V8's background compilation queue. This is
a benchmark-harness safeguard for that runtime, not a product runtime flag;
supported CI Node 20 jobs use no extra flag.
